# Scaffold

This repository is a basic scaffold for all templates I create. It uses the following technologies:

- Bower
- Gulp
- Node.JS
- SCSS

Basically, it sets up the style folders and `gulpfile` to jumpstart creating a new mockup or template.

To get started, all you have to do is `cd` to the root of the repository, and then type:

	gulp
	
Gulp will start, compile all of your CSS assets, move fonts to where they're supposed to go, and
then watch for any changes to your stylesheets, fonts, or Javascripts.
